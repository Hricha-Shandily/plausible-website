No technology is perfect, and we believe that working with skilled security researchers across the globe is crucial in identifying weaknesses in any technology.

If you believe you've found a security issue in our product or service, we encourage you to notify us. We welcome working with you to resolve the issue promptly.

### What is a Vulnerability Disclosure Program?

A Vulnerability Disclosure Program (VDP) is the "see it, say it, sort it" of the internet. We encourage security researchers to report any behaviour impacting the information security posture of Plausible Analytics products and services.

Please document your findings thoroughly, providing steps to reproduce and send your report to us.

* Reports with complete vulnerability details, including screenshots or video, are essential for a quick response.
* We will contact you to confirm that we’ve received your report and trace your steps to reproduce your research.
* We will work with the affected teams to validate the report.
* We will notify you of remediation and may reach out for questions or clarification. You must be available to provide additional information if needed by us to reproduce and investigate the report.

We've managed to collect $78,000 over the two years of this initiative and have made donations to different projects including the Red Cross, the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation, the Sea Shepherd, the Ocean Cleanup and the Mossy Earth.

Donation fund summary:

Year | Donation
------ | ------
2021 | $20,000
2022 | $58,000

**Summary 2021**: We've rounded up our donation fund for the year 2021 to $20,000. We donated half of that to the Red Cross for their Ukrainian collection. The rest we donated to the Erlang Ecosystem Foundation, the Sea Shepherd and the Ocean Cleanup.

**Summary 2022**: We've managed to almost triple our donation fund in the year 2022. We've started a rewilding membership with the Mossy Earth as the main donation for the environment and have also donated to projects chosen by our team. 

**Update 2023**: After collecting $78,000 over the last two years, we've decided to not continue with the fund in the year 2023. We will update this page with any similar initiatives in the future. Thank you for helping us make a bit of a difference!

We've improved the accuracy of the "Locations" report. Visitors that use VPN services are now grouped under the “Anonymous VPN Service" entry in the Countries tab. This eliminates noise that VPNs add to locations and makes it easy to view the percentage of your visitors using VPNs.

On a related note, it’s now possible to block traffic from particular countries from being recorded in your dashboard. This is a more permanent option compared to our filtering which allows you to temporarily exclude traffic from some countries when doing reporting. [See more here](https://plausible.io/docs/countries#how-to-block-traffic-from-specific-countries).

P.S. January not only marked our 5th anniversary but it was also our best month yet in terms of MRR growth! We’re celebrating these milestones with our first logo redesign in all this time. Hope you like it!

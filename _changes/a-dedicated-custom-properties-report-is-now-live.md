You can now find a dedicated tab for "Properties" within the "Goal Conversions" report of the dashboard. This tab provides a list view of all the custom properties you're collecting, both at the custom event and the pageview levels. 

To see all properties in the list, you must first explicitly add them in the "Properties" section of the site settings, similar to how it works for custom events themselves. You can add all the existing properties with a single click. 

This feature also gives you the flexibility to choose which properties you want to display (or not) in the dashboard list, similar to the control you have over custom events.

We've made our custom events simpler for sites that use CSS classes. You can now add a CSS class name to any element on your site to start tracking conversions. [Details here](https://plausible.io/docs/custom-event-goals).

Does your site use the ID attribute instead? It's now simpler to set up custom events with ID attributes too. See an example in [our Webflow instructions here](https://plausible.io/docs/webflow-integration).

P.S. "Direct / None" traffic is now shown in the main view of Top Sources as well. Happy holidays!

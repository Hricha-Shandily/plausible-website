Universal Analytics, the current version of Google Analytics, [will be sunset](https://plausible.io/blog/universal-google-analytics-is-dead) and will stop counting stats on July 1st 2023. Thereâ€™s no way to import your historical Universal Analytics stats into the new Google Analytics 4, so we've put a lot of effort into making a Google Analytics stats import tool ourselves. 

You can now import your historical Google Analytics (Universal Analytics) stats into your Plausible dashboard. The stats are imported from your first Google Analytics visitor until your first Plausible Analytics visitor. [Learn more here](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import).

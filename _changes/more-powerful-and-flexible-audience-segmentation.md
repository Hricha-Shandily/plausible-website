You can now segment your audience by "does not contain" in addition to "is", "is not" and "contains”.

Explore [the “Filter” menu](https://plausible.io/docs/filters-segments) where you can also search for anything or filter traffic by multiple entries (say multiple countries or multiple referral sources).

Note that when you view a specific audience segment, [your marketing funnels](https://plausible.io/docs/funnel-analysis) are filtered to show only the activity from that segment.

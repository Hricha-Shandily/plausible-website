Our GA4 import functionality now imports your custom events data as well. If you've previously imported the GA4 property and wish to include your custom events, please delete the previous import and do a new import. [Details here](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import#goals).

We've also improved the process of adding custom events as goals in your site settings. You can now add all existing events with a single click. [More here](https://plausible.io/docs/custom-event-goals#3-create-a-custom-event-goal-in-your-plausible-account).

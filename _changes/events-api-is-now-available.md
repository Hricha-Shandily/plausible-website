In addition to the [stats API](https://plausible.io/docs/stats-api) and the [sites API](https://plausible.io/docs/sites-api), we now also have the events API. You can use it to record pageviews and custom events. This is useful when tracking mobile apps or for server side tracking. [Learn more here](https://plausible.io/docs/events-api).

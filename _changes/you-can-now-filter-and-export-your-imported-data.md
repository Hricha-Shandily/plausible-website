We've made some improvements to the imported data from UA, GA4 and CSV:

1. **Filtering imported data**: You can now filter imported data directly from the dashboard and within the stats API. Please note that due to its nature, the imported data filtering capability is limited compared to our native data filtering. [Details here](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import#filtering)

2. **Exporting imported data**: You can now export imported data using the [CSV export](https://plausible.io/docs/export-stats) and the [stats API](https://plausible.io/docs/stats-api#imported-stats)

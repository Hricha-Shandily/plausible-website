Click on the download icon on the top right of your Plausible dashboard. It will download a ZIP file which includes CSV files of the individual reports. You can then import your stats into Excel or other data analysis tools.

You can even export a filtered view. Filter your dashboard and click on the download icon to get an export of that view. Click on any custom event such as external link clicks or 404 error pages to download those metrics.

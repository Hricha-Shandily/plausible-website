Click on the download icon on the top right of your Plausible dashboard. It will export a ZIP file which includes CSV files of the individual reports. You can then import your stats into Excel or other data analysis tools.

You can even export a filtered view. Filter your dashboard by any metric to get an export of that particular view. Segment the dashboard by any goal such as external link clicks, 404 error pages or custom events to download those metrics.

You can now get an email (or a Slack alert) when there's an unusually high number of current visitors on your site ðŸš€

Thanks to the [Changelog](https://changelog.com) team for [suggesting this](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/discussions/172) and helping us build it ðŸ™Œ

Here's how to [enable it for your site](https://plausible.io/docs/traffic-spikes) and how to [set up Slack alerts too](https://plausible.io/docs/slack-reports).

We’ve been working on improving our bot detection. We now:

* Block traffic based on the User-Agent header 
* Filter out known referrer spam domains 
* Block traffic originating from data centers 
* Detect and exclude unnatural traffic patterns 

All this is enabled for all sites out of the box so you don’t need to worry about having bots in your stats. 

P.S. Today marks 5 years since we launched Plausible! Thanks to your trust and support, we've grown to a team of 8 and have counted more than 73 billion pageviews in a privacy-friendly way! ❤️

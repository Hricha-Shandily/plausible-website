You can now compare your stats over time. Compare to the previous period, year over year or a custom period. Match by day of the week to avoid any discrepancies caused by the weekend.

You can filter your dashboard any way you wish to analyze a segment of your audience over time. You can also change the chart interval for a more granular comparison view. And if you've imported your historical Google Analytics stats, you can compare against those too.

Select "**Compare**" in the date picker or press the "**X**" key on your keyboard to start comparing.

You can now compare your stats over time. Compare to the previous period, year over year or a custom period. Match by day of the week to avoid any discrepancies caused by the weekend.

You can filter your dashboard any way you wish to analyze a segment of your audience over time. And you can change the chart interval for tailored stats comparison display too. 

Select "**Compare**" in the date picker or press the "**X**" key on your keyboard to start comparing.

Learn more [about the comparisons here](https://plausible.io/docs/compare-stats) and have fun exploring!

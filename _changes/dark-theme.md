We now have a dark theme! ðŸŒƒ

We follow your system theme by default but logged in users can manually choose either system, dark or light theme in [the account settings](https://plausible.io/docs/dashboard-appearance).

Thanks [@nurodev](https://github.com/NuroDev) for the initial theme design and [@Vigasaurus](https://github.com/Vigasaurus) for making it [come alive](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/discussions/115)!

There's now a testing tool to help you check if Plausible has been integrated correctly. It sends test traffic to your site to ensure that everything is working. And if we encounter an issue with your integration, we will provide tips on how to fix it.

You can find the testing tool both as part of the onboarding process for a new site and directly in the site settings of any site. [Learn more](https://plausible.io/docs/troubleshoot-integration).

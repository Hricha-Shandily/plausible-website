We're celebrating the end of Google's Universal Analytics by announcing three new features:

* **Funnels**: You can now follow the visitor journey from a landing page to a conversion with our multi-step [funnel analysis](https://plausible.io/docs/funnel-analysis).

* **Revenue goals**: You can now assign [monetary values](https://plausible.io/docs/ecommerce-revenue-tracking) to custom events and track marketing revenue attribution for your ecommerce store.

* **Custom props for pageviews**: You can now attach [custom properties to pageviews](https://plausible.io/docs/custom-pageview-props) too and open up a whole new range of use cases: stats by user role, login status, language, author, category and more.

These features will become a part of our new business plans later this year. They're free-to-use during the preview but will be exclusive to business plan subscribers after that. More details will be announced in the upcoming weeks.

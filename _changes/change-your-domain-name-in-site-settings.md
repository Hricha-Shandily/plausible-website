Domain name changes just got easier! ðŸŽ‰

Visit your site settings and update your domain name directly. No need to reach out to us for help anymore.
  
The instructions [are here](https://plausible.io/docs/change-domain-name).

P.S. We've got a new WordPress developer on board so we just released a new version of our plugin. It now tracks file downloads, custom events can be setup using CSS class names, you can exclude pages and user roles from being tracked and more. [Details here](https://plausible.io/wordpress-analytics-plugin).

Do you record [custom properties](https://plausible.io/docs/custom-props/introduction) alongside pageviews and/or custom events?

You can now segment your audience by multiple custom properties. Just keep selecting additional custom properties in your dashboard as you’re filtering. 

You can use the filter button on the top right of the dashboard to do the same too. There we’ve also added the “contains” option for even more powerful segmenting.

P.S. It’s now easy to exclude your IP address from being counted in your stats. [See how here](https://plausible.io/docs/excluding).

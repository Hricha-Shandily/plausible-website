Since the launch in 2019, we’ve continuously worked to improve our product and infrastructure. We now have 8 full-time team members and several paid external contributors. We don’t have any investors, so all this is solely funded by the fees our 12,038 subscribers pay us. Thank you for your trust and support! ♥️

One of our commitments has been stability in pricing. Nobody likes price hikes, so we've refrained from increasing the cost of Plausible subscription for our loyal subscribers so far. We plan to continue with that approach. 

In light of this, we’ve just introduced our new "Business" subscription plan. The "Business" plan is designed to offer more advanced business features while helping us cover our costs.

If you want to keep access to these premium "Business" features, which currently include [funnels](https://plausible.io/docs/funnel-analysis) and [ecommerce revenue](https://plausible.io/docs/ecommerce-revenue-tracking), you can upgrade to the new plan with the latest pricing. If you upgrade to the new plan, the amount you've already paid for your current subscription will be adjusted for the remaining time, ensuring you only pay the difference.

If you don’t need these additional features, you’re welcome to continue on your current plan, paying the same amount as you used to. Regardless of your plan choice, we will continue investing in our product, infrastructure and team to bring you an even better experience in the future.

On a related note, we’ve launched a new feedback section to keep you updated on Plausible’s development and to hear your input. It lets you see what’s new and what we’re working on next. You can also vote on existing ideas or suggest new ones. [Check it out](https://feedback.plausible.io).

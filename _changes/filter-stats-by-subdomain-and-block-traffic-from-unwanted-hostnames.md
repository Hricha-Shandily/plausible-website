You can now filter your stats by hostname. This allows you to view a global overview of traffic across all hostnames as well as segment traffic by individual subdomains all in the same Plausible dashboard.

Itâ€™s possible to apply a hostname filter both by using the filter button in the dashboard and through the stats API.

Learn more about [hostname filtering](https://plausible.io/docs/subdomain-hostname-filter).

Do you see some unwanted hostnames in your list? You can validate the origin of your traffic and block all unwanted hostnames. This feature is in addition to being able to block traffic by IP address, country and page. See how to [block specific origins of traffic](https://plausible.io/docs/excluding).

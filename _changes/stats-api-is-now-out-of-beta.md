Plausible Stats API is now out of beta! It offers a way to retrieve your stats programmatically. It is a read-only interface to present historical and real-time stats. Take any metric that you want, present it wherever you want in whatever shape you want. [More details in the API docs](https://plausible.io/docs/stats-api).

We've improved the way we handle international sites:

* Umlauts and other special characters (including numbers, dots and slashes) are supported so you can add international domain names to Plausible
* We automatically display the time format (24-hour or 12-hour am/pm) for the top graph timeline based on your browser's defined language
* We've improved how we deal with international time zones and daylight saving time changes

P.S. We've [reached $1M ARR](https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-saas) and are counting stats on 66,000+ sites with 2 billion pageviews per month between them. We're now a team of 8 solely funded by our 8,000+ subscribers. Thank you for your support! ❤️

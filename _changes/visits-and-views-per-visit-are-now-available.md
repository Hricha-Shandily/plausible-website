You can now find two brand new metrics in your dashboard: "Total visits" (Sessions) and "Views per visit" (Pages/Session).

We've made several less prominent enhancements too. A more accurate cities report, a more accurate screen size report, a more mobile-friendly top graph and improvements to the speed, consistency and stability of our service. For a comprehensive overview of all the changes we make daily, check out [our GitHub](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/commits/master).

P.S. Thanks to the support of our 9,500+ subscribers, we collected $58,000 in [our donation fund](https://plausible.io/giving-back) last year. Thank you for helping us make a bit of a difference! ❤️

We’ve improved our **CSV export** functionality. You can still export any segment of your audience directly from the dashboard but now you can also perform a full export from the site settings without any limits on the number of entries. [See more here](https://plausible.io/docs/export-stats).

And you can now also **import external data using CSV files**. The CSV import supports Plausible data by default but can also be used to import data from other sources if the external data is formatted according to our guidelines. See [the full details](https://plausible.io/docs/csv-import).

Note that our [Google Analytics importer](https://plausible.io/docs/google-analytics-import) is still the recommended option when looking to import the data from UA and GA4. And if you’re looking to transfer a site from one Plausible account to another, the [transfer ownership functionality](https://plausible.io/docs/transfer-ownership) is the recommended way.

This is a Jekyll site. Ruby is therefore required. `asdf` users can run `asdf install` and be on their way.

The site is bundled with `bundler 2.0.x`. Ensure you have the correct major version: `bundle --version`.

## Development

The standard Jekyll commands apply.

- Install dependencies: `bundle` and `npm install`.
- Run a development server: `bundle exec jekyll server`.

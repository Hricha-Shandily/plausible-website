Plausible Analytics is an open-source project dedicated to making web analytics more privacy-friendly. Our mission is to reduce corporate surveillance by providing an alternative web analytics tool which doesn't come from the AdTech world.

Plausible is trusted by 4,000+ subscribers. The full-time team is based in the EU and consists of [Uku Taht](https://twitter.com/ukutaht) and [Marko Saric](https://twitter.com/markosaric). We are completely independent, self-funded and bootstrapped. The legal entity is incorporated in Estonia while we work remotely and flexibly.

## Independent, self-funded and sustainable by the subscription fees our users pay us

Plausible Analytics development started in December 2018 and we launched our product in April 2019. While Plausible is an open source software that you can self-host on your server, we also sell a hosted, plug and play solution as a SaaS.

We run a [sustainable open source project](https://plausible.io/blog/open-source-funding) funded solely by the fees that our subscribers pay us. Revenue from subscriptions is used to pay our rent, further develop Plausible and allow us to commit to Plausible and open source full time. It also enables us to give back [5% of our gross revenue](https://plausible.io/giving-back) to the environmental causes and open source projects that we rely on.

We are not interested in raising funds or taking investment. Not from individuals, not from institutions and not from venture capitalists. Our business model has nothing to do with collecting and analyzing huge amounts of personal information from web users and using these behavioral insights to sell advertisements. 

We don’t make money by selling or sharing your data, or abusing your visitor’s privacy. When using Plausible Analytics, you 100% own and control all of your website data. This data is not being shared with or sold to any third-parties. 

Since we don't make money from advertising, we need to charge a fee to keep the project going. This is why Plausible Analytics is not free as in beer. We choose the subscription business model rather than the business model of surveillance capitalism. 

## Is it possible to have privacy-friendly web analytics?

[We founded Plausible Analytics](https://plausible.io/blog/the-analytics-tool-i-want) to create a privacy-friendly alternative to very popular and widely used surveillance capitalism web analytics tools that are installed and tracking user behavior on the majority of websites online.

Some people don't use analytics at all and that's fantastic. We don't push our solution on people who don't want to track anything
about their website visitors. We also encourage server log analysis as a privacy-friendly solution. Unfortunately, server logs have a big bot detection problem.

From speaking to many website and business owners, it is evident that going without any analytics at all or using server logs is not a viable alternative for the majority of them. Most of them want some useful insights into what their efforts result in. If privacy-activists insist they switch to server logs or they remove analytics completely, they will just keep using privacy-intrusive options that they are used to.

Our goal is to reduce the number of websites and businesses online that run proprietary, user-hostile and privacy-invasive web analytics products. We do that by providing them with a competitive, useful and actionable analytics product that at the same time respects the privacy of their website visitors.

## What makes Plausible Analytics a more privacy-friendly alternative to the average web analytics tool?

* We are completely open source so anyone can view, review and inspect the code we're running to verify whether our actions match with our words

* We minimize any data collection in general and whatever we do track is kept fully secured, encrypted and hosted on a server in the European Union to ensure it is being covered by the strict laws on data privacy

* We do not track and collect any personal data or personally identifiable information. [Comparing Plausible Analytics to server logs](https://plausible.io/blog/server-log-analysis), in server logs you can see all the IP addresses of your visitors and details on when they visited your site while there is no way to get any kind of personal data from Plausible Analytics

* We do not track individual people. All the data is in aggregate only

* We do not track people across their devices. All the data is isolated to a single device only. There is no way to know whether the same person visits a site from more than one device

* We do not track people across websites and apps that they visit. All the data is isolated to a single website only. There is no way to know what other websites someone visits

* We do not use cookies and we do not generate any persistent identifiers. We generate a random string of letters and numbers that is used to calculate unique visitors on a website and we reset this string once per day. All the data is isolated to a single day only. There is no way to know whether a person comes back to a site on another day

* We do not share or send the data to any advertising companies or any other third-parties in general. The data is not monetized, mined and harvested for personal and behavioral trends. The website owner completely owns and controls the data from their website

* We have an in-built feature that we recommend all website owners use to open up their stats to the public and share it on their site to be fully transparent so their visitors and anyone else can view the data that they have access to

See our [data policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy) for the full list of data we do collect to display your web stats and which metrics we use the data for. We also have a deeper look into how Plausible Analytics is built to be a [privacy-friendly web analytics](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics) tool that's compliant with the different privacy regulations.

## How do you prevent Plausible Analytics from going from "Don't be evil" to "Be evil"?

Plausible Analytics is a fully libre and open source startup. Our code is [free and open source](https://github.com/plausible/analytics/) under the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 (AGPLv3) or any later version.

Good intentions are not always enough and being open source is the best way to prevent us from going from "Don't be evil" to "Be evil". Our code is not proprietary and our users are not locked down so we have to be the best business running this codebase. The threat of forking is a real threat and if we make some evil choices or sell out to some evil corp, you can take the code and have your own Plausible Analytics. This keeps us honest.

Imagine if you had the same choice with your favorite proprietary and closed source app so if they decided to change the strategy, to make user-hostile decisions or to sell out to a corporation with different beliefs, the community could simply take over and keep alive the product that they love while ignoring the new development. You can do that with Plausible Analytics.

## Is there an ethical way to do marketing for a startup?

Our main marketing strategy is content marketing. We simply publish posts that we think people may find interesting and useful. Then we share that content on our social media channels. We also share this content in the different niche communities and aggregators that we are a part of.

Some of the people that discover our content and find it valuable end up signing up for a Plausible Analytics account too. Read more about how we do [startup marketing](https://plausible.io/blog/startup-marketing).

Here's what we don't do:

* We don't do any paid advertising or paid marketing campaigns on social media, on search engines and anywhere else. There is nothing inherently wrong with advertising if people give their proper consent to it or if it is contextual only without any personalization, we just don't do it.

* We don't pay anyone to recommend Plausible Analytics to their audience be it via referral programs, affiliate programs or other types of sponsorships. There is nothing inherently wrong with affiliate marketing as long as it is always prominently and clearly disclosed to the people, we just don't do it.

* We do not participate in any link buying or link selling to game the search engines to send us more traffic

* We ignore all unethical proposals such as those that offer us to buy contact lists of customers of other web analytics products

* Here's a full list of all the [best marketing practices that we say no to](https://plausible.io/blog/best-marketing-practices).

A large percentage of our growth can be attributed to website and business owners who love to use Plausible Analytics and decide to share their Plausible Analytics experience with the world.

We are grateful to everyone who shares Plausible Analytics as without people spreading the word about us it would be difficult for us to grow and achieve our goal. Thank you!

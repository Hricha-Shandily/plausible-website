TL;DR: Plausible Analytics is incorporated, built and hosted in the EU with all website stats exclusively processed with servers owned and operated by European providers. If Google Analytics no longer allows you to fulfill the legal requirements that apply to you, do check us out.

## Google Analytics is illegal according to the Austrian DPA

The Austrian Data Protection Authority has decided that the use of Google Analytics [violates the GDPR](https://noyb.eu/en/austrian-dsb-eu-us-data-transfers-google-analytics-illegal) as it is "subject to surveillance by U.S. intelligence services and can be ordered to disclose data of European citizens to them". This is because [the CLOUD Act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CLOUD_Act) allows US authorities to demand personal data from Google, Facebook and other US providers, even when they're operating in another jurisdiction.

This is the first DPA decision regarding EEA-US data transfers and it's an exciting development for European privacy-first providers such as Plausible Analytics. According to Max Schrems and the noyb.eu team, this decision is relevant for almost all European websites. 

Most websites use Google Analytics, Facebook Connect and/or other US-owned cloud services. There were similar recent cases concerning the use of [Stripe](https://noyb.eu/en/edps-sanctions-parliament-over-eu-us-data-transfers-google-and-stripe) and the use of [Cookiebot / Akamai](https://iapp.org/news/a/new-eu-data-blockage-as-german-court-would-ban-many-cookie-management-providers/). 

Noyb has [filed 101 complaints](https://noyb.eu/en/101-complaints-eu-us-transfers-filed) throughout Europe concerning sites using Google Analytics and Facebook Connect. Similar decisions are now expected to drop in Germany, the Netherlands and other EU member states. You can read a more detailed [legal analysis here](https://gdprhub.eu/index.php?title=DSB_(Austria)_-_2021-0.586.257_(D155.027)).

Before this ruling, we've listed many reasons [why you should remove Google Analytics from your site](https://plausible.io/blog/remove-google-analytics). This ruling is just the cherry on top. We don't want to spread fear, uncertainty and doubt as a marketing technique. If you're targeting Europeans, you should consider how this affects you and the US-owned services that you're using. 

We encourage you to discuss Google Analytics and this specific ruling with your lawyer to help you decide whether Google Analytics still allows you to fulfill the legal requirements that apply to you.

## Plausible Analytics is a genuine European Google Analytics alternative

If you are looking for a genuine EU alternative to Google Analytics, do give Plausible a chance. We're an independent and bootstrapped project incorporated in Estonia. Our team is based in Estonia and Belgium. All visitor data we collect is hosted in Germany on servers owned by a German company (Hetzner). We use a Slovenian-owned provider for our global CDN (Bunny).

This ruling makes Plausible an even more interesting [Google Analytics alternative](https://plausible.io/vs-google-analytics) to an even more significant number of sites. Thousands of sites, startups and some of the world's leading brands have already switched from Google Analytics and other services. Plausible is built for scale and can serve sites with hundreds of millions of monthly visitors.

We're a profitable and sustainable open source project with more than 5,500 paying subscribers. Currently, 30,654 different websites use Plausible and we're counting more than one billion pageviews per month. We've put together [a list of people tweeting about using Plausible](https://twitter.com/PlausibleHQ/timelines/1311218983912308736) if that helps you.

## Privacy-first web analytics

We're a privacy-first web analytics service and we minimize any data collection in general. We don't use cookies, browser cache nor local storage. We don‚Äôt generate any persistent identifiers and there's no cross-site nor cross-device tracking with Plausible.

Our priority has always been to never collect nor store any personal data in the first place, so these types of rulings affect us less than Google Analytics and other services that are part of surveillance capitalism. Still, since the EU-US Privacy Shield was invalidated, we started putting more resources into using EU owned and operated service providers.

We've always stored all the site data we collect in the EU. In the past, we used DigitalOcean for the servers and Netlify for the CDN and DDoS protection. These are both US-owned operators. We've recently changed to use servers owned and operated by European companies exclusively instead.

## Powered by European-owned cloud infrastructure

Last year, we moved to Hetzner, so all of the data we collect is hosted in Germany on a German-owned server. More recently, we've made the switch to Bunny (a Slovenian-owned provider) for the global CDN and DDoS protection:

* All of the data that Plausible tracks and collects is kept fully secured, encrypted and hosted on renewable energy powered server in Falkenstein, Germany. Hetzner, a European company, owns the server. This ensures that all of the website data is being covered by the European Union's strict laws on data privacy.

* For our CDN and DDoS protection, we use Bunny, another European-owned provider from Slovenia. Using a global CDN means having a fast loading script no matter where your visitors are based. We're proud to have one of the most lightweight JavaScript snippets in the analytics industry. Clocking in at [less than 1KB](https://plausible.io/lightweight-web-analytics) (45 times smaller than Google Analytics), our script will not add any bloat to your website or cause any performance issues.

You don't have to worry about Schrems II and that it invalidates the EU-US Privacy Shield when using Plausible. Your website data is exclusively processed with servers owned and operated by European companies and it never leaves the EU. You can read more about what makes Plausible a [privacy-first web analytics tool](https://plausible.io/privacy-focused-web-analytics) and a more technical overview in [our data policy](https://plausible.io/data-policy).

As always with Plausible, we're fully transparent and open source. Don't like the European Union and the European-owned cloud providers we use for our infrastructure? You can [self-host our analytics](https://plausible.io/self-hosted-web-analytics) with any cloud provider and in any country you wish. Even in the USA.

## We choose the subscription business model rather than surveillance capitalism

Plausible Analytics is not free unlike Google Analytics. Plausible is not collecting and analyzing vast amounts of personal information from web users and using these behavioral insights to sell advertisements. With Plausible, you 100% own and control all of your website data. This data is not being shared with or sold to any third-parties.

We choose the subscription business model rather than the business model of surveillance capitalism. To keep the project development going, stay in business, continue putting effort into building a better product and cover our costs, we need to charge a fee.

Feel free to explore Plausible using our trial. We have [a free 30-day trial](https://plausible.io/register) with no credit card required and no other restrictions. You can use Plausible the same way as if you had an active paid subscription during the trial. It should give you enough time to test the features you're interested in. This will give you a better idea of how it all works and whether Plausible is the right solution for your needs.

We don't do [any paid ads, retargeting and other privacy-intrusive marketing](https://plausible.io/blog/best-marketing-practices). We rely on people like you who enjoy what we do to help us spread the word and de-Google more sites. Thank you for being so supportive!

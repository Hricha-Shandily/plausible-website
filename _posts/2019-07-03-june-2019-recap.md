I spent the second half of June back home in Estonia to recharge my batteries and reconnect with family+friends. Summer solstice is a huge celebration in Estonian culture so everyone seems to be on holiday at the moment, enjoying nature, good food and drinks. I havenâ€™t had as much time for Plausible as I normally do, but Iâ€™m totally OK with that.

Still, some cool things happened with Plausible this month:
* ðŸš€ **Shipped public stats pages:**You can now show off all the hard-earned traffic to your site
* ðŸš€ **Added support for ?ref= query param:** Link tagging is a common practice to get accurate referrer information. This feature allows you to manually control the referrer.
* ðŸ’µ **MRR growth: 43.5%:**  Monthly revenue is at $67.91, up from $47.34 in May.
* ðŸ‘© **1347 unique visitors:**  Up from 1178 visitors in May. A lot of this traffic is organic from Google, Twitter, and the blog. I also do my best to participate in communities like IndieHackers which drives a lot of traffic.

Iâ€™ve also been working on [Plausible documentation](https://plausible.io/docs) to make sure the product and features are crystal clear to everyone. I believe that good documentation is a competitive advantage, and I plan to spend more time improving the docs.

### Looking forward

My main project in July is taking part in the [IndieHackers 30 days of growth challenge](https://www.indiehackers.com/post/871a026ac6). This will be a good test of my persistence and growth skills. The goal I've set for July is to get 40 new trial signups.

In terms of feature work, you can check out [the public roadmap](https://plausible.io/roadmap). The features not necessarily in the order Iâ€™m going to tackle them because Iâ€™m always trying to prioritise the easiest and biggest wins first.

Hope everyone has an amazing July. Stay tuned for the next update!

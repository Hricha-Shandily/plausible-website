Google just dropped big news on the business and marketing world! Universal Google Analytics, the current version of Google Analytics, will be sunset and will stop counting stats on July 1st 2023. The new Google Analytics 4 will be replacing Universal Analytics.

## What's going on with Google Analytics?

> We will begin sunsetting Universal Analytics — the previous generation of Analytics — next year. All standard Universal Analytics properties will stop processing new hits on July 1, 2023.

Here's [the full announcement post by Google](https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/analytics/prepare-for-future-with-google-analytics-4/).

Google is killing the universal Google Analytics but they've also announced that people will not be able to keep their historical stats. You'll be able to access the previously collected data in Universal Analytics for at least six months.

Google will soon "provide a future date for when existing Universal Analytics properties will no longer be available". After that, you'll lose access to your historical stats.

And the third big shock is that there's no way to import your historical Universal Google Analytics stats into the new Google Analytics 4 edition.

Google is now strongly encouraging people to "make the switch to Google Analytics 4 as soon as possible" as "doing so will allow you to build the necessary historical data" in the new GA4.

## Why the forced move to Google Analytics 4?

This move is happening because Google is betting on the Google Analytics 4 edition. Google is trying to get all the sites to make the switch from the Universal Analytics to the GA4.

Google Analytics 4 allows websites to follow a "unified user journeys across their websites and apps". It features "expanded integrations with other Google products, like Google Ads". 

Because of the issues with the privacy regulations, the blocking of cookies and an increasing usage of adblockers that leave Google Analytics with a significant gap in data, the new Google Analytics is using "machine learning technology to surface and predict new insights".

Google is also trying to join a more privacy-first web claiming that Google Analytics 4 is "designed with privacy at its core" and that it will no longer store IP addresses of the visitors.

## GA4 has been met with a backlash

Google Analytics 4 was introduced in July 2019 but has been met with [a lot of negativity](https://www.searchenginejournal.com/google-analytics-4-backlash/411392/) and a backlash from the wider business and marketing community. 

The main criticism seems to be that Google Analytics is moving from being a tool for marketers and site owners to being a more advanced tool for data analysts instead.  

The user interface is even less intuitive than before. It's even more challenging to use. Instead of having access to a suite of reports, you now have to build your reports from scratch. It's still very slow.

Even regular reports that everyone expects from their analytics tool are difficult to access. There are guides online for how to check simple stats such as the UTM tags that are driving traffic or entry pages that visitors land on using GA4. Even a simple report such as the one that tells you all the pages that get traffic on your site is a challenge to find.

## What can you do now?

First of all, there's still time. You have until July of 2023 to decide your next move.

If GA4 excites you, set it up and try it out. See how it feels. Does it provide everything you need in an analytics tool? If you're happy with what it does, then you're all set and no further actions needed. 

If that's not the case, we have put together [a list of best Google Analytics alternatives](https://plausible.io/blog/google-analytics-alternatives). 

One of these alternatives is a tool we're building ourselves. It's called Plausible Analytics. And here's what makes Plausible a [good alternative to Google Analytics 4](https://plausible.io/vs-google-analytics).

## Why is Plausible better than GA4?

1. Plausible is built to be simple to use and understand. We present only the most important traffic insights and metrics. All of the data we collect fits on one single page and can be scanned in one minute.

2. With Plausible, you're fully in control of the data you collect. Your website data is not shared with advertising companies or any other companies in general. It is not sent to any third-parties at all. It is not mined and harvested for personal and behavioral trends. Your website data is not monetized.

3. Plausible has built-in compliance with the different privacy regulations. We don't use cookies, we have no cross-site or cross-device tracking and we don't build any long term identifiers either. Plausible is also a European startup using exclusively EU-owned cloud infrastructure. 

4. Plausible keeps your site fast to load. Plausible Analytics script is more than 17 times smaller than the Google Analytics script and more than 45 times smaller than the recommended Google Analytics integration using the Google Tag Manager. 

5. Google Analytics script is blocked by many people who use adblockers such as the uBlock Origin and from users of some mainstream browsers such as Firefox. With tech-savvy audiences, the level of people blocking Google Analytics [gets up to 60%](https://plausible.io/blog/google-analytics-adblockers-missing-data). Plausible doesn't need machine learning to predict what happens on your site. We can simply show what actually happens as we don't see the same level of blockage. 

6. Plausible is not a part of the surveillance capitalism. Google Analytics is free because Google has built their company and their wealth by collecting and analyzing huge amounts of personal information from web users and using these personal and behavioral insights to sell advertisements. We choose the subscription business model rather than surveillance capitalism. We're operating a sustainable project funded solely by the fees that our subscribers pay us.

7. Plausible is fully open source web analytics. Our source code is available and accessible on GitHub so anyone can read it and review it to ensure it keeps the data private and secure.

8. Plausible is growing fast! We now have more than 6,000 paying subscribers, we're tracking stats on more than 37,000 websites and we're counting more than one billion pageviews per month.
